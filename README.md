# octue-app-matlab
Template for creating apps for build and deploy on octue

## Quick start


### Creating a new app from the template

1. [Fork this template repository on github.](https://github.com/octue/octue-app-matlab#fork-destination-box). This will create a new repository in your (or your organisation's) GitHub account, where your app will reside.

2. Choose a name for your new repository. Call it whatever you like!

3. Clone your new app template to begin work. You'll need the Octue SDK too. From the terminal of your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<your-repo-name>
git clone https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-matlab
```


### Turn the template into an octue app

Your forked template already contains a working example app. So let's set up the build system straight away...

1. If you haven't already, [install the Octue App on your Github Account](https://github.com/marketplace/octue), making sure to give it permission to access your new app repository.

> **Tip**
> Giving access to all repositories lets you very easily connect new repositories and add dependencies within Octue. But it's OK if you're not comfortable with that much exposure. You can simply choose which repositories to hook to Octue. YOu can always change this or add new repositories to Octue in your GitHub Settings. If you're doing this on behalf of an Organisation, you'll need admin privileges.

2. [Start the 'new application' workflow](https://www.octue.com/applications/new).

3. Enter a name for your app (it doesn't have to be the same as the repository name, it can be more human-readable) and a description.

4. In the 'Connect' step, your new repository should appear in the drop-drop down list. If not, you can check your GitHub installation in [your profile settings](www.octue.com/users/me)

5. Once connected, to the repository, you can tag your app (more on tagging [here]) or just leave tags blank for now.

6. Proceed and build! Your [applications view](www.octue.com/applications/my) on octue will show build status.

7. By default, each new push to the master branch on GitHub will automatically generate a new build of your app. You can alter this behaviour [here]().


### Run a trial analysis

1. Once your application build shows as complete, [start the 'new analysis' workflow](https://www.octue.com/applications/new) and select your newly built app.

2. You'll see a dialog of configuration parameters. This has been autogenerated from the `schema.json` file in your app directory - feel free to tweak and change the values that your app will receive.

3. Launch the analysis - there's no need to add any extra tags or datasets unless you want to.

4. [Check run status and results of your newly launched analysis]( TODO ).


### Next steps

1. Try modifying the run() function to return different results. To re-build, simply commit your changes to the master branch, and push to GitHub.

2. You'll want to think about the control parameters, environment and files that your app should use. These can all be defined in the schema.json file, which is [described in the octue docs]( TODO ).

3. Read our [porting guide]( TODO ) for tips and tricks when porting existing applications to Octue. It might be easier than you think!

4. Check the code in our [advanced app example]( TODO ) to see all the great features you can add with just a few lines of code - intelligent file manifesting, progress monitoring, kill commands, auto reporting, web-interactive 3d figures, database access... and more!
