Origins
=======

ODAS flow began as an internal tool at RSI, for processing marine measurement data.
It was originated in MATLAB, and grew incrementally in response to client need, released as a collection of MATLAB scripts.

A schema has been developed and ODAS has been ported to an app on the Octue platform, in response to teh need for cloud based processing of large datasets, together with improved auditability and reporting.
